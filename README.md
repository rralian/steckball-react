# Steckball-React

This project is an application to manage a college bowl betting pool that my family runs (for fun of course). It was previously being managed by sending excel spreadsheets around by email and a lot of manual tallying like we're a bunch of cavemen or something.

I've had a few false starts on this thing... put a couple hours in, abandon it for a couple months, then come back and Meteor (the underlying framework) has changed so much that I wind up starting over and relearning. The last version was decent~ish and then some assholes broke into our house and stole all our stuff... including the computer where this project lived. And for some dumb reason I hadn't saved it anywhere useful. Gawdamnit.

So I am now building this thing as badly and ugly as possible to just get the damn thing out. I hope it hurts your dumb eyes.
